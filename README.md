# AttendanceAutofill
This is a python script that utilizes the selenium module to automatically fill out attendance forms made in google forms.

Please bear in mind that this is specifically made for my own school attendance form, so I will not be including the xpath that I originally written down.

This script supports:
  Name and attendee's number autofill
  Multiple actions depending on the input that the user had written in the terminal
  
To use this script you might need to:
  Look for the destination xpath on each question on the form.
